MPOAuth
=======

Framework to perform requests to OAuth secured services like Twitter, Foursquare, Linkedin, ...

_NOTE:_ This fork has been changed to use the delegate mechanism instead of notifications for signaling authentication success/error and to use blocks as callbacks for request loading instead of target/action.

__This has only been tested with OAuth services like Twitter, Linkedin, ... other authentication methods have not (yet) been testet!__
